    and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys.' I don't know. Maybe it was
    the way he said it, but... it was like he wasn't exactly saying it sucked.
    He was just asking me honestly, 'Is that all you got?' And for some reason,
    I thought to myself: 'Yeah, man, I can do better.' So I started from scratch.
    I made another, then another. And by the end of the semester, by like box
    number five, I had built this thing. You should have seen it. It was insane.
    I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood. It was
    fitted with pegs, no screws, I sanded it for days, until it was smooth as g
    lass. Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark.
    It even smelled good. You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it
    was... it was perfect."

    @post_2 = "You... are trouble. I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it,
    but I sure as hell do. You are a time bomb. Tick, tick, ticking. And I
      have no intention of being around for the boom. Well... you know how
      they say, it's been a pleasure? It hasn't. Well, I guess that's it.
      Parting thoughts of which I have two. First: as I said I'll handle the
      legacy costs out of my end so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore.
      Second: the bug. The DEA will do a sweep can't say when, could be any time.
      But you need to get it out of there sooner rather than later. Alright.
      Just get the bug, Walter."

    @post_3 = "Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. Just gonna
    call you Skyler if that's okay. It's a lovely name. It reminds me of the
    big, beautful sky. Walter always told me how lucky he was, prior to recent
    unfortunate events. Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in
    lawyers: only the very best with just the right amount of dirty. Walter,
    I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in
    the shakedown racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?
    Especially drug dealers."

    @post_4 = "Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos. I must've said Cheetos like
    ten times. You need me to write it down for you? Well, I'm just saying,
    y'know, I said Cheetos. Ch-ch-ch sound. Virtually impossible to confuse
    Cheetos with Fritos it seems to me. Where are you going?
    So things are quiet, y'know? Not a lot of crystal on the streets right
    now. Well, we keep hearing a name. Heisenberg. Lately pretty much every
    dimebagger we come across. Yeah, I know. Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.
    Still, somebody somewhere is cooking that big blue we keep finding.
    Come here... closer... Asshole."

    You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.
    But with this... you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be
    any taste or smell... thirty-six hours later... poof. A man his age,
    working as hard as he does... no one will be surprised. Mike can have his
    suspicions, but that's all they'll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.
    Look, I'll give you Jesse Pinkman, OK? Like you said, he's the problem,
    he's always been the problem and without him, we would... and he's in town,
    alright? He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell you're looking for him.
    He's right here in Albuquerque and I can take you to him, I'll take you
    right to him. What do you say?"
