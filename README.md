Iron Yard Assignments


Assignment 4 <br>
Use the following code to create a Ruby file and run it. The file can be run either by ruby filename or, if you choose, you can set the executable bit (chmod +x filename) and add a shebang.
puts 3 > 4 puts (3 * 2) > 10 puts 2 == 3 puts (1 > 0) && (2 <= 1) puts 2 != 2 puts (14 <= 10) || (2 >= 3) puts 10 % 2 == 1 puts (10 ** 2) == 1000 puts 1000 / 300 > 4
Now change the code above so that when you run it, all the equations are true.
Please create a gist of the final code and paste the url of the gist in an issue comment.

Assignment 6<br>
Create code for each comment in this gist
Run the code and paste the output into your issue as a comment for this assignment
It should list all the proper class names and all class tests should result in 'true'
Before you run it, can you guess what will happen with the constant code you've created?


Assignment 7<br>
Create a Ruby script to ask the user for their name and then wish them a Happy Birthday by name
Add some comments to your code
Put this code in a gist and paste the link from the gist in a comment of this issue

Assignment 8<br>
Read<br>
Review<br>
Play<br>
Write a Ruby script to do the following:<br>

Take the string "Hello World" and split it on whitespace. Show two ways to do this.

Use the Peter Piper tongue twister and split it on 'pick'
Use gsub only to change the first passage to the second in the fewest amount of commands:
Original: "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go..."

Result: "I have brains in my head. I have feet in my shoes. I can steer myself any direction I choose. I'm on my own. And I know what I know. And I'M the one who'll decide where to go..."

Write code to determine how many times 'sh' occurs in the following phrase:
There once was a man who had a sister, his name was Mr. Fister. Mr. Fister's sister sold sea shells by the sea shore. Mr. Fister didn't sell sea shells, he sold silk sheets. Mr. Fister told his sister that he sold six silk sheets to six shieks. The sister of Mr. Fister said I sold six shells to six shieks too!

In the same phrase above, how many times does 'sh' occur when followed by an 'o'? Show the code.
Match the word foot but not football in this phrase: "He played football despite having an artificial foot.""
Match the last sits in a phrase using this phrase: "I saw Susie sitting in a shoe shine shop. Where she sits she shines, and where she shines she sits."

Assignment 9<br>
Take a string from the user, reverse it, remove the last character and reverse it again (no shortcuts)
Be sure if the user enters whitespace on either side of the input, that you remove it first
For the original text input by the user, count how many words (as separated by spaces) and print this count.

Assignment 10<br>
Request input of a number from the user.
Iterate the number of times indicated by the input number
Within the loop, print the number of the iteration
Do this for each of these methods of looping: while, for i in range, loop, until, .times with counter, range with each
All should print from 1 to the number input by the user


Assignment 12<br>
Create an array of questions (Strings)
Iterate over the array using each, asking each question to the user
Bonus: Save all the answers with the questions, and print a summary at the end

Assignment 13<br>
Create a guessing game
The user must guess the number chosen by the app
Provide feedback to the user as to if their guess is lower or higher than the number
Count the number of guesses and output at the end

Assignment 14<br>
Using the structure of a class as I've laid out in this gist, finishing creating the PigLatin class to translate a word into pig latin
Bonus: modify the app to convert an entire phrase (one word at a time)
Note the pig latin rules in the comment of the skeleton app
