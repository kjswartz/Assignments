    Oooh<br />
    <br />
    We're no strangers to love<br />
    You know the rules and so do I<br />
    A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br />
    You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br />
    <br />
    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br />
    Gotta make you understand<br />
    <br />
    Never gonna give you up<br />
    Never gonna let you down<br />
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
    Never gonna make you cry<br />
    Never gonna say goodbye<br />
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
    <br />
    We've known each other for so long<br />
    Your heart's been aching, but<br />
    You're too shy to say it<br />
    Inside, we both know what's been going on<br />
    We know the game and we're gonna play it<br />
    <br />
    And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br />
    Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br />
    <br />
    Never gonna give you up<br />
    Never gonna let you down<br />
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
    Never gonna make you cry<br />
    Never gonna say goodbye<br />
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
    <br />
    Never gonna give you up<br />
    Never gonna let you down<br />
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
    Never gonna make you cry<br />
    Never gonna say goodbye<br />
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
    <br />
    (Ooh, give you up)<br />
    (Ooh, give you up)<br />
    Never gonna give, never gonna give<br />
    (Give you up)<br />
    Never gonna give, never gonna give<br />
    (Give you up)<br />
    <br />
