  <div>
    So I'm back, to the velvet underground<br />
    Back to the floor, that I love<br />
    To a room with some lace and pAper flowers<br />
    Back to the gypsy that I was<br />
    To the gypsy... that I was<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    Well, you know that it does<br />
    Well, lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice<br />
    Ah, and it lights up the night<br />
    And you see your gypsy<br />
    You see your gypsy<br />
    To the gypsy that remains faces freedom with a little fear<br />
    I have no fear, I have only love<br />
    And if I was a child<br />
    And the child was enough<br />
    Enough for me to love<br />
    Enough to love<br />
    She is dancing away from me now<br />
    She was just a wish<br />
    She was just a wish<br />
    And a memory is all that is left for you now<br />
    You see your gypsy<br />
    You see your gypsy<br />
    Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes<br />
    (She was just a wish)<br />
    (She was just a wish)<br />
    And it all comes down to you<br />
    Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice<br />
    And it all comes down to you
