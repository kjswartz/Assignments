    <p>Gypsy" is a song by the rock group Fleetwood Mac. Stevie Nicks wrote
      the song originally circa 1979, and the earliest demo recordings were
      recorded in early 1980 with Tom Moncrieff for possible inclusion on her
      solo debut Bella Donna. However, when Nicks' friend Robin Anderson died
      of leukemia, the song took on a new significance and Nicks held it over
      for Fleetwood Mac. "Gypsy" was the second single release and second
      biggest hit from the Mirage album, following "Hold Me", reaching a peak
      of #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks.</p>

    <h2><a href="blog_post3.html">Yesterday</a></h2>
    <h3>Word Count: 134</h3>
    <p>"Yesterday" is a song originally recorded by English rock band the
      Beatles for their 1965 album Help!. Although credited to "Lennonâ€“McCartney",
      the song was written by Paul McCartney. It remains popular today with more
      than 2,200 cover versions[3] and is one of the most covered songs in the
      history of recorded music.[note 1] At the time of its first appearance,
      the song was released by the Beatles' record company as a single in the
      United States but not in the United Kingdom. Consequently, while it topped
      the American chart in 1965 the song first hit the British top 10 three
      months after the release of Help! in a cover version by Matt Monro.
      "Yesterday" was voted the best song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC
      Radio 2 poll of music experts and listeners and was also voted the No. 1
      pop song of all time by MTV and Rolling Stone magazine the following year.
      In 1997, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
      Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) asserts that it was performed over
      seven million times in the 20th century alone.</p>
