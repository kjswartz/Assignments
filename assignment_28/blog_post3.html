  <div>
    Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away<br />
    Now it looks as though they're here to stay<br />
    Oh, I believe in yesterday<br />
    <br />
    Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be<br />
    There's a shadow hanging over me.<br />
    Oh, I yesterday came suddenly<br />
    <br />
    Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say<br />
    I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday<br />
    <br />
    Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play<br />
    Now I need a place to hide away<br />
    Oh, I believe in yesterday<br />
    <br />
    Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say<br />
    I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday<br />
    <br />
    Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play<br />
    Now I need a place to hide away<br />
    Oh, I believe in yesterday<br />
    Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
